# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repo contains the R script ("run_analysis.R"), codebook and tidydata.txt file for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

## Brief summary of analysis performed by the run_analysis.R script

* Downloads Data and creates a Data Directory
* Reads data into R and creates preliminary data sets
* Creates a combined data set with test and train data sets as well as variable names and   descriptive activity names
* Extracts only the measurements on  the mean and standard deviation for
  each measurement
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each   activity and each subject
* Writes to TidyData.txt file

## Original Assignment Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
